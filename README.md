# Analysis and Applications of VRFs
In this project we will implement in Python a VRF protocol using EC based on Bitcoinâ€™s ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) digital signature scheme 
in order to solve the problem of Anti-Exfil.

## Reference Implementations

The purpose of this implementation is for solving the Anti-Exfil problem of Bitcoin ECDSA signatures in a most efficient way. We measure this efficiency in the number 
of messages and not in size, since in this type of transaction the important thing is the number of communications.
